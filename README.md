# FIle-Order
A python application which moves the files into folders(Directories) based on the Date of the last Modification. Great help for people with tonnes of pictures and other files , all in the same folder. If a file has been modified on 05/31/2012, the program will move it into a folder named "5 2012". We can specify what type of files we want to move.
